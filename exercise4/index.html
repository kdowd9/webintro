      <div class="dryer"></div>
      <div class="info">
        <h3>Maholos Hair Dryer (1930s) shows how form and function can work together. It is made from brass and metal and it was shaped to fit the human head and evenly dry hair. This is a design this is still used in salons today. I like how its structure feels both practical and elegant. This is a turning point in design because it transformed a simple tool into something shaped by both purpose and comfort.</h3>

      <h2>Artificial Nails</h2>
      <div class="acrylic"></div>
      <div class="info">
        <h3>Bernadette Thompson's Money Manicure (1990s) turns acrylic nails into a bold form of art and identity. They are made with acrylic paint, imitation paper money, pearls, and rhinestones. I like how Thompson used everyday materials to express power and individuality. I think it feels like a turning point in design because it shows how something as small as a manicure can be a form of self-expression and it created a new art form.</h3>

      <h2>Swatch</h2>
      <div class="swatch"></div>
      <div class="info">
        <h3>Swatch (1983) redefined what a watch could be. They are made of plastic and metal, which allowed it to  shift from being a luxury object to something affordable, colorful, and fun. Instead of the traditional handmade metal watches with 150 parts, the Swatch used only 51 parts and was assembled automatically. It was a turning point in design because it made technology and fashion accessible to everyone.</h3>

      <h2>Tabis</h2>
      <div class="tabis"></div>
      <div class="info">
        <h3>Martin Margiela’s Tabi Boots (1988) transform the traditional Japanese split-toe sock into a bold fashion statement. The design reimagines a pre-existing form in an unexpected and modern way. I like how Margiela turned something historic into something completely new and expressive. It is a turning point in design because it challenged fashion norms and showed how old ideas can inspire radical creativity.</h3>

      <h2>Crinkled Metallic Fabric</h2>
      <div class="metallic"></div>
      <div class="info">
        <h3>Junichi Arai's Crinkled Metallic Fabric (1995) blends tradition and technology. Made from polyester and aluminum split yarn, the fabric shimmers and shifts with light, giving it a modern, almost futuristic feel. I love how Arai used computer techniques on traditional textiles. Its texture feels both fragile and strong, reminding me of the balance between art and technology.
